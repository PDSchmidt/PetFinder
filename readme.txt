Excercise 3 - API Consumption

This website has three tabs, each with at least one different API endpoint being incorporated.

TAB1: Famous Dog Advice
DESC: Generates a random dog picture and pairs it with a random piece of 'advice', quoted from a random dog.
USE: Clicking "New Pup" button changes the picture with another API call
     Clicking "New Quote" button changes the quote with another API call, then changes the name of the quoted dog using one of the random 50 generated by the first API call to the name database. (No need to keep making API calls, we get 50 the first time and changing them at random should suffice)
APIs:
    PICTURE: Generated using "https://random.dog/woof.json".
    ADVICE: Generated using a call to "https://api.adviceslip.com/advice".
    DOGNAME: Generated using a call to "https://data.seattle.gov/resource/jguv-t9rb.json?species=Dog".

TAB2: Find-a-Friend
DESC: Using sliders, set values for certain dog characteristics and get a selection of
      recommendations based on the values.
USE: Change slider values, then press "Discover Pets!" button. If the API call returned
     recommendations matching the values selected, the "Candidate Report Card" will populate
     with information about the first recommendation. If there are more than one breed mathching the criteria, you will be able to navigate via the "Next" and "Previous" buttons to view them.
     ***NOTE: Because of limitations of the API, only EXACT MATCHES will return a result. Thus, you will find it difficult to generate results. For testing purposes, try the following:
     (SHEDDING: 2 BARKING: 5 ENERGY: 4 PROTECTIVENESS: 4 TRAINABILITY: 3) - Generates 3 results
     (SHEDDING: 3 BARKING: 3 ENERGY: 3 PROTECTIVENESS: 3 TRAINABILITY: 3) - Generates 6 results
     (SHEDDING: 3 BARKING: 3 ENERGY: 3 PROTECTIVENESS: 3 TRAINABILITY: 3) - Generates 3 results
API:
    BREEDINFO+PIC: https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/dogs?shedding={shedding}&barking={barking}&energy={energy}&protectiveness={protectiveness}&trainability={trainability}

TAB3: Adoption Centers
DESC: Using an input text field that accepts a 5-digit number representing a zipo code, display on a map the
      Points of Interest that return from a search using the keyowrds "pet adoption" from Google centered around the zip-code. Clicking on a pin will update info about the search result in the Business Information card.
USE: Enter a zipcode into the input field and click "Change Zip" button to prompt an API call. If there is a
     valid response, the pins will be dropped on a map and the mapview will change to the first pin generated representing a search result. Click on one of the red pins generated by the search to display information about the point of interest.
APIs:
    TURNING ZIP INTO "geocode" TO ACCESS THE LOCATION: 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address='+ $('#zipInput').val() + '&key=AIzaSyBddz5EchHxoPdqlZ_FGKMjjDch7fcOpW4';
    SEARCH: new google.maps.places.PlacesService(map).textSearch(request, function(results, status){...});
    DETAILED INFO ABOUT A RESULT: new google.maps.places.PlacesService(map).getDetails(theResult, function(info, status) {...});
